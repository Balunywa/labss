You can only specify 1 unique APIPA address per VPN GW instance (1 IP for A/S, 2 IPs for A/A). Same goes for the scenario with no APIPA where the BGP speaker IP comes from the GW subnet. When you specify APIPA on the VPN GW, the BGP source is listening only and will not initiate the BGP session. That is not the case when using the GW subnet “method”. You can have both APIPA and the GW subnet BGP speakers running at the same time (see lab below). Even when you have both APIPA and GW subnet configured, and the remote side BGP source is APIPA, the remote side can peer with the BGP speaker in the GW subnet. In that scenario, the VPN GW APIPA address will show as the next hop.
